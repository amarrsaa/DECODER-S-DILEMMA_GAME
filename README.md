Below is a step-by-step guide on how to run the Prisoner's Dilemma project:

## Running the Project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Move into the directory of the cloned repository using the `cd` command:
   ```
   cd prisoner-dilemma-project
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Code:**
   There are two main scripts in the project: `prisoners_dilemma.py` and `prisoners_dilemma_testing.py`.
   
   - To run the training phase of the project, execute the following command:
     ```
     python prisoners_dilemma.py
     ```
   
   - To run the testing phase of the project, execute the following command:
     ```
     python prisoners_dilemma_testing.py
     ```

5. **Interact with the Program:**
   - During the training phase, you can observe the progress of the AI agents as they learn to play the Prisoner's Dilemma game.
   - During the testing phase, you can observe the performance of the trained AI agents against various testing scenarios.

6. **Explore the Results:**
   After running the code, you can explore the results, which may include visualizations of agent performance and analysis of outcomes.

7. **Adjust Parameters (Optional):**
   If desired, you can adjust the parameters in the configuration section of the code files to customize the behavior of the AI agents or the experiment setup.

8. **Contribute (Optional):**
   If you're interested in contributing to the project, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request with your improvements or bug fixes.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run the Prisoner's Dilemma project and explore its functionality. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please refer to the project documentation or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance.
